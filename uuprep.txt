Documentation for UUPREP, Version 1.0,
   written 1992 by Johannes Martin (JMARTIN@VZDMZX.ZDV.UNI-MAINZ.DE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Usage:
------
  UUPREP <inputfile> <outputfile>

  Note: UUPREP will append ".uue" to both filenames


Purpose:
--------
  UUPREP facilitates the decoding of binaries from comp.binaries.os2.
  It expects an inputfile containing all articles that belong to one
  binary in any order including headers and footers.
  UUPREP save this articles in the correct order to the outputfile,
  removing all headers and footers. After doing this it executes
  "UUDECODE <outputfile>" to decode the binary.


Compilation:
------------
  To compile UUPREP type "make -f UUPREP.mak".
  (I used emx/gcc to compile, but other compilers also should work)
